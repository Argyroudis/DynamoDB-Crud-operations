# DynamoDB-Crud-operations
In these operations there is code that does the crud operations in 2 tables using node.js, each one has a unique id but also 
they connect because the second table has as a field the unique id of the first table and also another same field called company
name.The difference of the special operations as i named them is that they are using both tables in order to do a different operation 
version than the common.
