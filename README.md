# DynamoDB-Crud-operations
Crud operations in DynamoDB for AWS lambdas 
In these operations there is code that does the crud operations in 2 tables, each one has a unique id but also they connect because the 
second table has the as a field the unique id of the first table and also another same field called company name.The difference of the 
special operations as i named them is that they are using both tables in order to do a different operation version than the common.
